The Elision of Scaff' - performance work. Scaff' struggles to come to terms with his life, he is preoccupied, distracted and perpetually in a state of astonishment...his task is made more difficult by the fact that there are three of everything, including him. "It's a nursery where we force cylinders into square holes and cubes into round ones while our parents and proctors aren't looking. Does it work? Depends on the day." - Francois Caradec This new work is inspired by the literary constraints of the French writing group OuLiPo (Ouvroir de Litterature Potentielle, or Workshop of Potential Literature). The performance has been generated through the indiscriminate and unapologetic application of constraint after constraint after constraint after constraint.....etc
