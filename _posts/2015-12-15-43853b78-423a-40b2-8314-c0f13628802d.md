The Speech Maker - durational performance.

The Speech Maker offers an opportunity for the people of a city to get on their soapboxes... without having to actually get on their soapboxes.

The Speech Maker borrows the words of the people that have shaped our history and fits them seamlessly with the voices that represent our city.

This durational work is a testament to 'telling people what you think', it is a snap-shot of a city's aspirations, dreams, fantasies, failures and frustrations.

The Speech Maker is truly participatory. Watch him deliver his rhetoric and, through the seamless beauty of technology, put words in his mouth -- contribute your own gripes, celebratory messages, political manifestos -- all contributions will be threaded live through The Speech Maker's 12hrs of non-stop speech -- put words in his mouth.

Performed at the Compass Festival of Live Art, Leeds, and the Sibiu International Theatre Festival, Romania.
