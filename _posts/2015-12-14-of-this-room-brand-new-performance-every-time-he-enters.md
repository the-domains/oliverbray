Of This Room - brand new performance, every time. He enters the space and reads it. He reads you. Then he makes a performance happen. This performance will never be repeated because it is entirely dictated by the room and the people in the room. The performer will respond to everything that happens in the room using a complex set of (in)visible formulae and constraints.  Somewhere in between winging it and trusting in fate, this performance relies entirely on the live-constructed moment and the decisions made when a performer is faced with a room of people watching, waiting, expecting. This work is the final installment of Oliver Bray's infatuation with the OuLiPo (the Workshop of Potential Literature) -- and this time, it's got risky.
