The Animal Was Upon Him.

This performance is a ridiculous conversation, a wry two-hander of nonsensical, pseudo-philosophical badinage and silliness. It's a trip to a Victorian zoo, a filthy reading of astral constellations and what it's like to be an ape. But it's also really complicated, with more moves than the average game of chess\* and a lot more swearing. 

"Rats who build the labyrinth from which they will try to escape." Raymond Queneau.

Since 1960, the Ouvroir de Litt√©rature Potentielle, the Workshop of Potential Literature, has used constraints and restrictions to generate new writing. This work is a live-annotated example of redesigned OuLiPo constraints applied to a live theatrical context. Echoing the playful, often funny and unpredictably accessible ethos of the OuLiPo, every moment of this performance is the result of an imposed constraint, without exception.
