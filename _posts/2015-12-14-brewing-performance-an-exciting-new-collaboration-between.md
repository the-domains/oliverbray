Brewing Performance - an exciting new collaboration between Leeds Beckett Performing Arts and The Tetley, Leeds. 

Between January and June 2015, performance makers from Leeds Beckett University teamed up with local artists and delivered performance provocations in and around The Tetley - the series culminated in the Brewing Performance Symposium in June. This ongoing project, that sees the coming together of two of Leeds' most important cultural organisations, promises to throw up some fascinating and radical new performance interventions in the future.
