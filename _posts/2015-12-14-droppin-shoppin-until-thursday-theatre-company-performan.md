Droppin' Shoppin' - Until Thursday Theatre Company Performance.

Droppin' (v) To demonstrate wisdom or skill. "I'm droppin' science" (Coolin' in Cali, 1988)

Droppin' Shoppin' isolates the richest qualities of two non-theatre source materials - Hip Hop and Channel Shopping, and strips them to their barest performative components. Hip Hop becomes a drum-kit and a microphone, channel shopping becomes a sofa and a smile. Hints at creative manifestos, friendly engagement and black culture may seduce the viewer into seemingly understanding this unnerving world, before repelling them with the disjointed reality of two middle class white boys telling the fake why they can't create. 

Coz this is what it's about, come on...
