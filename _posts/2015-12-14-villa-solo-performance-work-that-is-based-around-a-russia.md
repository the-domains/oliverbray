Villa - solo performance work that  is based around a Russian family's tragic story of loss. 

Villa is as much about idiotic British naivety as it is pseudo-philosophical wordplay and Chekhov.  Some of you will be implicated, directly.  Some of you will enjoy the story, a bit.  Some of you will be amused, at it.  But know this -- I'm on my own, my suit is sharp and someone is going to have to sit in those chairs.  One can only kill starlings for so long. A foray into Eastern Europe that subtly upsets those narrative conventions that we pretend not to be so desperate for.  This work, which tastes a little of Chekhov, smells like a Beckett rip-off and stinks, actually, of empire-building naivety, acknowledges the refusal of any mind not to get it. We've never been the manifesto-writing island, and so -- perhaps a trip to Russia is in order.
